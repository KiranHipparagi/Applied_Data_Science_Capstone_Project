# Case Study
Okay, let me introduce the contacts of the capstone project through a scenario.Say you live on the West side of the City of Toronto in Canada.You love your neighborhood mainly because of all the great amenities and other types of venues that exist in the neighborhood.Such as gourmet fast food joints, pharmacies, parks, grad schools,and so on.Now say you receive a job offer from a great company on the other side of the city with great career prospects.However, given the far distance from your current place,you unfortunately must move if you decide to accept the offer.Wouldn't it be great if you're able to determine neighborhoods on the other side of the city?There are exactly the same as your current neighborhood, and if not,perhaps similar neighborhoods that are at least closer to your new job. 

# Summary
This capstone project will give you a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with data. It uses the location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. This project demonstrates about how to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. During the project, I have learn how to be creative in situations where data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing HTML code. I have utilized Python and its pandas library to manipulate data, which helped me to refine my skills for exploring and analyzing data. Finally, I have used the Folium library to great maps of geospatial data and to communicate my results and findings.
